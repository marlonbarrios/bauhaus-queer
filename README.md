## About the Project

**Bauhaus Time Traveler | Duet in Latent Space** is an application developed by Marlon Barrios Solano, showcasing a unique blend of concept, programming, sound design, and performance. It was brought to life during an artistic and research residency at Lake Studios Berlin in February 2024.

Latent space refers to a conceptual and mathematical space generated by algorithms, particularly those used in machine learning and generative models. This space is characterized by the high-dimensional representation of data where similar data points are mapped closely together, and dissimilar points are further apart. In essence, latent spaces serve as the underlying structure that models use to understand and generate new data instances based on learned patterns, without being explicitly programmed with specific rules for every possible outcome.

The intention to perform in latent space, especially with a model, is to perform within an unknown probability space, utilizing the generative capabilities of the model to create art or perform in real-time. This process involves interacting with the model in a way that it generates outputs based on the vast, unseen dimensions of the data it has learned from, yet doing so in a manner that is unpredictable and unique to each performance. The artist, by manipulating inputs (prompts) or guiding the model's generative process, improvises with these outputs, creating an interplay between the expected and the unexpected, the known and the unknown. This act of performing in real-time within latent space becomes a dance with the probabilities.

### Composition

The project is an amalgamation of various elements including software development, a space for performance as a live app that runs in the browser, a sound space crafted with Musicgen, and a video capturing the process. Additionally, users can immerse themselves in the experience by playing the soundtrack created specifically for the app. 

## Deployment

It can be an installion, a webpage, a live performance and an online performance lecture.

### Features

- **LCM Turbo:** Leveraging the power of Fal.ai for (almost) real-time, instant text-to-image conversion.
- **Soundtrack:** A specially composed soundtrack that users can play, enhancing the visual experience with a complementary sound space | created with AI Musicgen model.
- **Innovative Design:** Drawing inspiration from the Bauhaus movement with ideas of time travel.
- **Sound Design & Performance:** Marlon Barrios Solano integrates sound landscapes and performance space in front of laptop.
